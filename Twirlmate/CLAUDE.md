- Filter by state, tier, type, and organization
- Month/year navigation for calendar view
- Animated picker overlays with smooth transitions

### 🎨 Adaptive Design System
- Full light/dark mode support using Apple's design colors
- Dynamic color theming throughout the app
- Consistent visual hierarchy and spacing

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Expo**: Development platform and tooling
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **React Navigation**: Tab-based navigation structure

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: `https://twirlmate.com/api/v1/mobile/`
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `/events/` - Main events API with month/year/search filtering
  - `/events/recently-added/` - Recently added events (with truncate param)
  - `/events/closing-soon/` - Registration closing soon (with truncate param)  
  - `/events/happening-soon/` - Upcoming events (with truncate param)
  - `/events/by-state/` - Events filtered by state
- **State Images**: `https://www.twirlmate.com/static/pages/images/states/{STATE}-transparent.png`

### Data Models

#### EventDateListItem
```typescript
interface EventDateListItem {
  id: number;
  mobile_detail_url: string;
  start: string; // Event date
  registration_open: string;
  registration_close: string;
  registration_upcoming: boolean;
  registration_available: boolean;
  registration_closed: boolean;
  event: {
    name: string;
    location: string;
    image: string;
  };
}
```

## File Structure

### Main Components
- **`app/(tabs)/events.tsx`**: Primary events interface with tab management
- **`components/EventCard.tsx`**: Horizontal scrolling event cards for discovery sections
- **`components/EventsList.tsx`**: Reusable vertical event list for category pages

### Route Structure
